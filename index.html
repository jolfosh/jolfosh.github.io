          <h3>why is this site so ugly?</h3>
          <p>
            Hold on a second. Isn't this the personal webpage of a software
            developer? Shouldn't this page be nice and pretty to showcase my
            awesome web development skills? Well... <b>Yes and No</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all, I think this site is beautiful. Maybe it's nostalgia
            for websites in the early 2000s. Maybe it's the minimalism and
            simplicity that appeals to me. Maybe it's the elegent
            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a>
            font. Maybe it's even a breath of fresh air from all the attention
            grabbing, data sapping, mind manipulating garbage that currently
            occupies most of the public facing distopian web. Ignoring my social
            commentary, I've designed this site with the intention of showing
            the beauty and performance HTML & CSS was created with, so thank you
            for taking the time to explore my little site.

          <h3>my software engineering journey</h3>
          <p>
            Beginning with my introduction to video games with our familiar
            plumber friend, I have had a life-long obsession with learning about
            how things work (mostly video games). This manifested with me
            tearing open computers and various devices to try to observe and
            track the beautiful black magic inside. As I ripped apart more and
            more things (and occasionally put them back together), I began to
            understand more and more devices without needing to savagely
            massacre them.
          </p>
          <p>
            After building my own computers and tinkering as far as my budget
            would allow, my curiosity eventually shifted towards the digital
            frontier. I wanted to make video games and write programs for the
            machines I had so lovingly obsessed over. So after leading the tech
            department at my highschool for 3 years, writing a thesis on the
            corruption and inessential incentive of four-year university,
            achieving an ACT score of 34, and writing an entrence essay on AGI
            (artificial general intelligence), I attended Oral Roberts
            University with the intent on studying Computer Information
            Technology with a full-ride scholarship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Skipping over the religious trauma and hypocracy, learning software
            development was just too slow for my indomnable curiosity, so after
            being denied the possibility to test out of courses or progress
            faster, my highschool thesis, which had been foreshadowing my
            destiny, came rushing back to my reality. You guessed it, I dropped
            out after the first semester. Thus began my journey learning
            software development alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I say alone with a grain of salt. With the amount of resources
            available for free on the internet, it wouldn't be hard to argue
            that I had a whole univerity education at my fingertips. I first
            learned C++ on <a href="">HackerRank</a> completing all their
            challenges to learn as I went. I then started to use my newfound
            powers to write Python scripts to automate parts of my job as an
            Office Manager for an amazing physical therapy clinic. This gave me
            a little experience, but after a year or so, a friend of mine was
            looking to hire a C++/Python Junior Developer for his startup. I, of
            course, hopped on board faster than my shoes could follow. It was
            there that I gained an amazing mentor (ex-Intel) who guided me and
            gave me the space and projects to learn real development best
            practices and production code.
          </p>
          <p>
            While, unfortunately the startup was put on an indefinate hold ("the
            axe"), it set up the experience I needed to break into the field
            without a college degree. I have now been a software engineer for ~3
            years and have had the opportunity to learn and work in many
            different languages and frameworks. I'm aware that I am still in the
            beginning of my career, but I am incredibly optimistic for the
            future and opportunities that may come.
